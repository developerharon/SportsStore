# 🏪 SportsStore

A sample **online sports store** web application, originally built using **ASP.NET Core 3.1 MVC with Razor Views**, based on the tutorial from the book **"Pro ASP.NET Core MVC 3" by Adam Freeman**.

The app allows customers to browse products and place orders with **payment on delivery** (no online payment integration yet). It's now being upgraded to modern technologies like **.NET 9**, **Blazor**, and a **Web API** backend.
