Chapter 8: SportsStore: A real Application

My application, called SportsStore, will follow the classic approach taken by online stores everywhere. I will create an online product catalog that customers can browse by category and page, a shopping cart where users can add and remove products, and a checkout where customers can enter their shipping details. I will also create an administration area that includes create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) facilities for managing the catalog, and I will protect it so that only logged-in administrators can make changes. 
My goal in this branch, and those that I will add is to give you a sense of what real MVC development is like by creating a realistic an example as possible. I want to focus on ASP.NET Core MVC, of course, so I have simplified the integration with external systems, such as the database, and omitted others entirely, such as payment processing. 
You might find the going a little show as I build up the levels of infrastructure I need, but the initial investment in an MVC application pays dividends, resulting in maintainable, extensible, well-structured code with excellent support for unit testing.
Most of the MVC features I use for the SportsStore application have their own chapters. 
I will call out each step needed to build the application so that you can see how the MVC features fit together. You should pay particular attention when I create views. You will get some odd results if you do not follow the examples closely.

Configuring the Application
The Startup class is resposnsible for configuring the ASP.NET Core application.
